# UnBroke

<!-- 
    Welcome to our web app! Our UnBroke code is split into 3 main parts inside "allstuff":
    
    - the business folder contains all files and code to diplay business home page, post and edit
    deals/sales data to firebase, and grab & display data grabs from firebase.

    - the student folder contains 2 parts, the Launch_Login_Signup which holds all the files
    to authenticate user login and redirect user to other pages on successful login.

    - the second part is student, where the student home is located. Here is the code that allows
    students to view, store, and print coupons.
